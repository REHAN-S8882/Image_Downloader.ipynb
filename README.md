# Image_Downloader.ipynb
 The code provides a functionality to download images from URLs and store them locally. Here's a breakdown:  Import necessary libraries: It starts by importing os, re, and requests, which are essential for file system operations, regular expressions, and making HTTP requests, respectively.  get_extension function: This function aims to extract the file extension from the provided image URL. It checks for common image extensions like .jpg, .png, .gif, etc. If a known extension is found in the URL, it's returned; otherwise, None is returned, indicating that the extension couldn't be automatically determined.  download_image function: This is the core function responsible for downloading and saving the image.  It first utilizes the get_extension function to determine the image's file extension. If the extension isn't found, it defaults to .jpg and issues a warning. It constructs the filename based on the provided name, folder, and determined extension. It sanitizes the filename to ensure it's compatible with the file system by replacing potentially problematic characters with underscores. Before downloading, it checks if a file with the same name already exists in the target location. If so, it raises an exception to prevent overwriting. It then uses the requests library to fetch the image content from the URL. Finally, it saves the downloaded content to a file with the constructed filename, ensuring it's written in binary mode ('wb'). It also prints a success message upon completion. If any error occurs during the process, it catches the exception and prints an error message. Main execution block (if __name__ == '__main__':): This block is executed when the script is run directly.  It creates a directory named 'images' if it doesn't already exist, ensuring there's a designated location to store downloaded images. It prompts the user to enter the image URL and the desired filename using the input function. It calls the download_image function with the collected user inputs and the 'images' folder as the target directory, initiating the download process. In essence, this code provides a simple yet effective way to download images from the web, handling common scenarios and potential issues. The use of functions makes it organized and reusable, and the error handling mechanism ensures robustness.
